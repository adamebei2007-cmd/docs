## Vision and scope

This platform is a full-stack, AI-powered fashion operating system that unifies discovery, styling, design, purchasing, wardrobe management, and social experiences. It connects consumers, creators, suppliers, and authenticators across a single experience that is driven by personal taste modeling and measurement-aware fit intelligence.

## Core concept

- Build an AI taste and fit profile from onboarding questions, stated preferences, and behavioral signals.
- Use that profile everywhere: recommendations, search relevance, outfit generation, closet usage, avatar sizing, and supplier selections.
- Combine owned wardrobe data, retailer catalogs, and supplier inventories to generate shoppable, remixable, and manufacturable looks.

## High-level user journey

1. **Authenticate and onboard** to capture style, budget, and measurement inputs and form the taste and fit baseline.
2. Land on a **dashboard** that surfaces recommendations, saved outfits, social updates, orders, and supplier shortcuts.
3. Explore the **Catalog** and **For You AI Search** to find branded items, alternatives, accessories, and price tiers.
4. Generate or curate outfits via the **Outfit Generator** and save them for later in **Saved Outfits**.
5. Upload real garments into the **Smart Closet** to personalize generation, avatar try-ons, and marketplace listings.
6. Design custom pieces in the **Design Studio** and route them to suppliers via the **Supplier Portal**.
7. Buy, sell, and authenticate items in the **Marketplace**, or share looks in the **Fashion Social Feed** and **Inspiration** boards.
8. Maintain **Measurements** and **Wishlist** data that flows into all modules, including the **3D Avatar** fitting experience.

## Module overview

### Authentication & taste onboarding

- Account creation is required before accessing core flows.
- Onboarding asks AI-analyzed questions about style categories, color palettes, budget, and brand affinity to build a taste vector and fit baseline.
- Outputs feed personalization services used across search, recommendations, outfits, and avatar sizing.

### Dashboard

- Central control panel showing AI recommendations, saved outfits, quick links to Smart Closet, supplier options, marketplace notifications, orders, and social activity.
- Surfaces next-best actions (e.g., "Try this look with your uploaded jacket" or "Authenticate your listing").

### Catalog (fast-fashion outlet hub)

- Aggregates products from brands like Zara, H&M, and Bershka with outbound links to official stores for purchase.
- Browsing and filters: category, occasion, style, price range, and brand.
- Personalization ranks items by taste profile and current season/occasion context.

### "For You" AI fashion search engine

- Natural-language search for requests such as "black oversized streetwear jacket".
- AI expands queries, searches multiple stores, and returns similar products, cross-brand alternatives, accessories, and price-tier options.
- Results are bias-corrected by the taste profile and fit signals.

### Outfit Generator

- Uses taste, seasonality, color preferences, occasion, and owned items to propose full looks.
- Supports regeneration, per-item tweaks, and saving presets.
- Can constrain generation to owned garments, catalog items, or supplier-ready designs.

### Saved Outfits

- Stores AI-generated or manually assembled outfits.
- Supports reordering, renaming, and deletion.
- Acts as input to avatar try-ons, social posts, and wishlist conversions.

### Smart Closet (upload real clothes)

- Users upload photos to digitize their wardrobe.
- Items are tagged, categorized, and made available to the generator and avatar.
- Maintains provenance between uploaded items and marketplace listings or outfits.

### My Clothing

- Distinguishes between purchases via platform links and manually uploaded pieces.
- Enables outfit creation restricted to real items for authenticity-first users.

### Design Studio

- Starts from factory-ready blanks and allows color, cut, texture, and logo adjustments.
- Outputs manufacturable specifications that can be ordered immediately, saved, or used to seed a brand line.

### Supplier Portal

- Lists manufacturers and available stock, including minimum order quantities when required.
- Accepts orders for both custom designs (from the Design Studio) and unmodified stock.
- Provides visibility into production status and fulfillment milestones.

### Marketplace (buy & sell)

- Two selling modes: open listings without authentication, and certified authentication (item is shipped to us for verification with a $30 service fee).
- Buyers search by brand, condition, size, and authenticity status.
- Integrates with Smart Closet so sellers can list from their digitized wardrobe.

### Fashion Social Feed

- Fashion-first social module with For You, Discover (style-similar users), Following, and Notifications.
- Users can post outfits, comment, like, follow, and send DMs (including outfits).
- AI curates feeds based on taste proximity, recency, and engagement quality.

### Inspiration tab

- Pinterest-style boards for saving, categorizing, and reusing fashion looks.
- Can promote inspiration pins into outfit generation seeds.

### Measurements

- Measurements entered manually or captured via phone scan.
- Feed into recommendations, fit predictions, and avatar sizing.
- Track deltas over time to keep fit accuracy fresh.

### Wishlist

- Save single items, partial looks, or full outfits for later purchase.
- Acts as a cross-module queue that informs recommendations and supplier demand signals.

### 3D Avatar

- Personalized avatar built from measurement data and style cues.
- Supports try-ons with AI-generated looks, catalog items, Smart Closet garments, and design prototypes.

## Target result

Deliver a one-stop AI-driven fashion ecosystem that lets users discover trends, design and manufacture pieces, manage a digitized wardrobe, try outfits on a personal 3D avatar, buy and sell with authenticity controls, and share socially—all powered by a continuously improving taste and fit profile.

## Cross-cutting AI services

- **Taste modeling:** vector representation trained from onboarding answers, browsing, purchases, and social signals.
- **Fit and measurement intelligence:** predicts size/fit recommendations and drives avatar dimensions.
- **Retrieval and ranking:** blends taste vectors, occasion/season context, and price sensitivity for search and recommendations.
- **Image understanding:** powers wardrobe tagging, outfit compatibility scoring, and inspiration ingestion.
- **Safety and authenticity:** detects counterfeit risk for marketplace listings and validates supplier outputs where possible.

## Data flow and interoperability

- Onboarding → taste vector and baseline measurements available to Catalog, Search, Generator, Avatar, and Supplier Portal.
- Smart Closet → generator constraints, avatar try-ons, marketplace listings, and social posts.
- Design Studio → Supplier Portal orders and Marketplace listings for custom pieces.
- Wishlist and Saved Outfits → dashboard highlights, social sharing, and purchase prompts.
- Measurements → size guidance, avatar updates, and supplier production specs.

## Operational considerations

- **Governance:** certified authentication flow introduces verification SLAs and fee management.
- **Privacy:** wardrobe images and measurements require clear consent and retention policies.
- **Scalability:** catalog ingestion, search indexing, and image processing should be asynchronous to keep the UX responsive.
- **Internationalization:** brand availability, sizing systems, and supplier minimums may vary by region.

## Success metrics

- Onboarding completion rate and taste profile coverage.
- CTR and conversion on personalized recommendations and AI search.
- Outfit Generator saves and downstream purchase rate.
- Smart Closet uploads and usage in outfits/avatar.
- Supplier orders per design and reorder frequency.
- Marketplace GMV and authentication opt-in rate.
- Social engagement (posts, DMs, saves) and inspiration-to-outfit conversions.
